Specification:

Version Checker

In preparation for our next conversation we would ask that you complete the following simple coding exercise.

This will help provide some insight into your background as well as create content for additional discussion.

Please write a web service that takes in two strings and returns a string indicating if the first string is before, after, or equal to the second string. 
Where "before", "after" and "equal" are based interpretation as software version numbers.

Examples:
1.0.0 is "before" 1.0.1
2.0 is "after" 1.0.0

You can use any language and when completed, please upload to a public repository such as GitHub and provide us with the link.
